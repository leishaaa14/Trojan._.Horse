<b>Objective</b><br>
The need for secure and convenient cardless cash withdrawal at ATMs, leveraging mobile phones and OTP authentication, to reduce frauds arising due to security risks associated with physical ATM cards.
<br>
<b>Description</b><br>
In light of the significant shift towards cashless payments
facilitated by various mobile payment applications such as Paytm
and Google Pay during and after the pandemic, we thought of the
benefits of transitioning Indiaâ€™s entire financial procedures to
cashless and cardless transactions.
<br>
<b>Key Features of our Project</b><br>

prevent card related frauds and provide more security.</li>
  <li>It has a user friendly UI which makes it easy to understand
and work with.</li>
  <li>User will be able to make any sort of transaction at the ATM
kiosk without any need of network connection.</li>
  <li>All the transactions come with security of decentralised
system. And each transaction is secured with a unique OTP

  </ul>
<b>Tech Stack used</b><br>  
HTML, CSS, Solidity, Figma, HardHat, Polygon, JavaScript, Node.js
<br><br>
  <b>Use Cases</b><br> 
  <ol>
    <li>A pin management system that leverages Polygon
Blockchain to store the transaction pins in a
tamper proof manner</li>
    <li>The Bulk SMS API provides the user with an OTP

SMS API within our banking system to transmit
One-Time Passwords (OTPs) to users, thereby
eliminating the dependency on internet
connectivity.</li>
